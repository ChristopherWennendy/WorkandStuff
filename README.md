SQL blog engine
Christopher Wennendy, Tina Lee , Anish Malhotra, Elvin Shoyfer

Simple blog engine, able to login and post. Searches for posts based on user and title. Replaced comments with ability to login/register, because we thought both served the same function with putting info in a sql database.
